When the user/buyer clicks on the reserve button, a confirmation message would appear where they would have to confirm. Once the user/buyer has confirmed that they would like to reserve, they would successfully reserve the product where it would be exclusive to them.

Once the user has successfully reserved the product, the product would appear in “Reserve” in the profile page. The user/buyer would be able to upload a proof of purchase via the “Upload Payment” button (an upload icon) as well as to unreserve the product via the “unreserve” button (a red x icon).

When the product has been reserved, it would be marked as reserved where no other users/buyers can reserve the product.

When the user clicks on the “Upload Payment” button (an upload icon), they would be able to upload a screenshot to validify that payment has been made. The screenshot of their proof of payment would directly be sent to the seller to be accepted or declined. If the seller has declined the payment, the user/buyer could continue to upload a proof of payment. If the seller has accepted the payment, a notification would inform the user/buyer and the product would be removed from the user/buyer “Reserved” in the profile page.

When users press on “Uploads” in the profile page, they would be able to sell their products by uploading a product to be listed.

Once the user/seller has uploaded a product to be sold, they would be able to view their products in the profile page under “Uploads”. The User/Seller would be able to view their listed products and its details, as well as view payments made for the product via the “Payment View” button (gold money icon), and to be able to delete their listings if they would want to via the “Delete” button (red rubbish bin icon)

When the user/seller has uploaded a listing, it would mean that the product would be able to be reserved, followed by purchased by other users/buyers. However, the application has made it such that the product can only be reserved by one user/buyer at one time. Therefore the user/seller of the product would also be able to unreserve the product to let other users/buyers to reserve their product.

In the application, the buyer would be able to show a proof of payment via a screenshot that can be uploaded directly to the seller. The user/seller would be able to view and verify that the payment from the buyer has indeed been made and accept or decline the payment accordingly. If the user/seller declines the payment made, the buyer would have to upload a new payment or negotiate with the user/seller.

Once the user/seller has accepted the proof of payment uploaded by the buyer, their product would be marked as sold. When the product is marked as sold, it cannot be reserved nor can a buyer chat with the user/seller.
